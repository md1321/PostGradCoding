<font size="6">Your First NumPy Array</font> <br>

<p>In this task, you'll get comfortable with the basics of numpy, a powerful package to do data science.
<p>Before starting the lab, please download the data from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qu_K7Uh8ilRvMLF0ajrA7fywWuHZJ0mh/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. Extract the folder from the zip file to a local folder in your computer. For instance, you can store them in C:/GEOG389_Yourname/Lab1</p>
<p>Please follow <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=17P7EKczkUxPOSnbOV1N3qUT9PY-fL5SU"> this instruction </a> to change the interpreter of PyCharm</p>

<p>Two lists of the heights (cm) and weights(kg) of baseball players have already been defined. You need to conver them to numpy arrays for element-wise operations.

<p>First, you need to convert the array of heights in centimeter to an array of heights in inches </p>
<p>Then, please calculate the body mass indices (BMIs) of the players using element-wise operators for numpy arrays </p>

<strong>You can run the code line by line in the interactive Python console. You can right-click on a line of code and click 'Execute Line in Console' or use the shortcut Alt + Shift + E.  </strong>
 <div class="hint">
  Use <code>import</code> to load the numpy package before using it.

<div class="hint">
  You may want to import numpy and assign an abbreviation to it. You can use <code>import ... as ... </code> to do that.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  Use <code>np.array()</code> to create a numpy array from a list. Name this array np_baseball.
