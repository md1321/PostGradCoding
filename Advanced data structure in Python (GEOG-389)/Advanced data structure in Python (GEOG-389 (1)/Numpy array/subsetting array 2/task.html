<font size="6">Subsetting array 2</font> <br>

<p>You can get a subset of an array using <code>np_array[i:j][m:n]</code>, which returns the part of the array from the (i+1)th to jth row, and from (m+1)th to nth column.</p>
<p> You can also omit the starting index to get elements until the ending index</p>
<p>Analogously, you can also omit the ending index to get elements from the starting index </p>
<p> Let's try some examples to understand how they work</p>
<br>
<br>
<div class="hint">
  You can use indices in <code>[]</code> to access individual element in an array. For instance, <code>np_array[a][b]</code> will return the element at the (a+1) row and (b+1) column.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  You can use <code>:</code> to get an entire row or column. For instance, np_array[1,:] will return the entire 2nd row.
</div>
