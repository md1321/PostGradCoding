<br>
<p>In a data frame, you can select rows according to the values in specific columns.
<br>

<div class="hint">
  You can right-click on election.csv in the file list (in the left panel) -> Copy Path to copy the full path of the file.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  Use <code>df[df.colname>3]</code> to select rows in which the value in 'colname' is greater than 3.<br>
  df[df['colname']>3] does the same.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  data frame is essentially built on a 2D numpy array. Thus, you can use <code>df.shape</code> to get the shape (dimension) of a data frame.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  df['column'].sum() will return the sum of numbers in 'column'. But this only applies to columns of numbers (integer, float, double), not string columns.
</div>
